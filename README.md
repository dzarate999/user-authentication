This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## User Authentication Using Okta

I designed this app to allow users to login. Once logged in, the user can view their user name and email from the staff page. 

### Next Steps

Currently, this app requires an admin to setup the user's info, the user then recieves an email to to setup their password. The next step is to allow users to register on the page or use a social platform to login.
